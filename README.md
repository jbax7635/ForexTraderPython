# ForexTraderPython
Asses pricing patterns and make trades automatically.
Still very early days for this project, this is a replicate of the java "forexTrader" project.
This is a forex trading machine learning project. This project will discribe current market state, find like previous states and random walk theory to determine forward path probability. This will likely be one layer of trading, this model assumes that all market behaviour has existed previously. For example, market panic has existed previously although fundamental reason may be different, approximate behaviour is replicatable. This idea may, or may not be correct or correct part of the time.
